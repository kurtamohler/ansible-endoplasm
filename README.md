Automated configuration setup for my Linux workstations

:warning: **I would not recommend you to run this repo!**: This is for my
convenience only. If you do insist on using it, please only run it on a clean
system that you don't mind messing up if things go wrong. Also, please read
through the scripts and understand them before running.

## Requirements

Start with a clean installation of [`Pop!_OS 22.04 LTS
(NVIDIA)`](https://pop.system76.com/).

## Installation

Run the following:

```bash
bash run.sh
```

When prompted, enter your password and accept any EULAs.

When the script is finished without error, restart your machine.

If there are any errors, you gotta figure out what's wrong.
